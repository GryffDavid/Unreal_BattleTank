## Unreal Tank Battle Game ##
Simple tank battle game to familiarise myself the Unreal Editor and Unreal C++ syntax. I already knew C++ and had extensive C# experience going into this, I just wanted to learn Unreal. 

- Can use keyboard and mouse or controller to control a tank
- Aim the turret on the tank and shoot at other tanks on the terrain
- Some simple AI that finds the player tank, aims towards it and shoots
- AI and player tank are controlled using the same methods
- NOT POLISHED
